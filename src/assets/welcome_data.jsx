This is a simple notes app with a toggle for Dark Mode—definitely worth trying.

How to Use the App:
1. Log In: Ensure you have an internet connection to save notes to the database; otherwise, they are stored temporarily on your device.
2. Add Notes: Click the 'Add Note' button to create a new note.
3. Edit Notes: Click 'Edit Notes' to modify. Don’t forget to click 'Save Note' after editing.
4. Search Notes: Use the search bar to find notes quickly by title or category.
         For title searches, type any part of the title.
         For category searches, prefix with : (e.g., :physics).
5. Delete Notes: Click 'Delete Note' to remove a note.
7. Log Out: Click the menu button and select 'Log out'.
